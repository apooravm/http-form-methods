HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers that indicate the status of a 
request-response cycle between a client and a server. 
Here's a brief explanation of the 5 types of HTTP status codes:

Informational (100-199): These status codes indicate that the 
server has received the request and is processing it, 
but the client should continue to wait for a final response. 
Examples include "100 Continue" and "102 Processing".

Success (200-299): These status codes indicate that the server has successfully received, 
understood, and processed the request. Examples include "200 OK" and "204 No Content".

Redirection (300-399): These status codes indicate that the requested 
resource is not available at the expected location, and the client 
needs to take further action to locate it. 
Examples include "301 Moved Permanently" and "307 Temporary Redirect".

Client Error (400-499): These status codes indicate that the client's request was malformed, 
unauthorized, or otherwise invalid. Examples include "400 Bad Request" and "401 Unauthorized".

Server Error (500-599): These status codes indicate that the server 
encountered an error while processing the request, preventing it from fulfilling the request. 
Examples include "500 Internal Server Error" and "503 Service Unavailable".

Understanding HTTP status codes is important for troubleshooting and debugging web applications, 
as they provide valuable information about the status of a request and what actions need to be taken to address any issues that arise.
